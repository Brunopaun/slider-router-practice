//--frontendmentor challenge--//

This website was created to practice some features like slider, routing, and react lazy. The challenge didn't specify what technologies could be used, instead, it mentioned that could be great trying to build the website using a framework and any technologies that would enhance the learning.  

So, we used react-responsive-carousel to set up our sliders which was a good practice of making use of libs. To practice a bit of sass, we developed the whole CSS with SASS using the modules approach.

--Learnings
When talking about responsiveness, I find complicated the use of sass as the only technology for building its CSS which could be sorted of with Tailwind. The project needs some improvements, most related to the implementation of react-responsive-carousel and its styles.
